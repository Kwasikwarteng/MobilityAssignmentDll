# Calling C++ DLL from C# Console Application

This is a sample C# console application that demonstrates how to call a C++ DLL.

## Overview

The C# application interacts with a C++ dynamic-link library (DLL) using Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke). The DLL contains functions written in C++ that the C# application calls.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio (for compiling C# application)
- C++ Compiler (for compiling C++ DLL)

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build both the C# console application and the C++ DLL.
4. Run the C# console application, which will call functions from the C++ DLL.

## Features

- Demonstrates how to call C++ functions from a C# application.
- Shows basic usage of Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke).

## Directory Structure

- `MobilityAssignmentConsoleApp/`: Contains the C# console application.
- `MobilityAssignmentDll/`: Contains the C++ DLL source code.
